# About Me
## My Interests
I enjoy exploring technology and programming especially new languages like Python and Javascript. I like going outside
and playing with my friends. I play the piano and also play soccer. Academically, I am interested in computer science, 
math, and AI related field.
## Websites I Recommend 
- [GitHub](https://github.com): This is where platformers and developers can collaborate and share projects. I really like to make projects and so this is a very helpful platform for me
to collaborate with others and share projects.
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org): This is where there are high quality courses from universites and companies. This helps me expand my knowledge in technology, 
science, and many more. Throughout the summer, I am planning to use this as a source for me to get certificates, understand courses and get some sort of internships.
